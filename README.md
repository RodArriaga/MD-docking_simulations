# MD-docking_simulations
This repo contains scripts used in my master's project in which I performed molecular docking using Autodock Vina and MD simulations of two IFIT proteins in complex with several RNA caps. All scripts are original (with their proper attributions readily documented), created to analyze post-dynamic and post-docking simulation data.
